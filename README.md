# Proved the correlation between data and bicycle demand and recommend the day for fixing	
MATLAB team project | August - December 2021<br/>

## Why we started this project
Since 2017, the project has renewed its deficit every year.<br/>
As the number of bicycles in operation increases, as well as the cost of maintaining and managing previously purchased bicycles and rental stations, Seoul public bicycle is running into a deficit.<br/>

**We would like to propose ideas that can improve the deficit factors of these businesses in order to help them turn profitable.**<br/>

## What we do?
* Used Seoul 3-year data (Traffic & Bus & Population & Subway)<br/>
* Data standardization and visualization by district<br/>
* Used Deep Learning Toolbox in MATLAB <br/>
* Proved the correlation between subway and bicycle demand<br/>
* Proved the correlation between population and bicycle demand<br/>
