# Predict-the-public-bicycle-demand-and-recommend-the-day-for-fix
MATLAB team project | August - December 2021<br/>

## Why we started this project
Since 2017, the project has renewed its deficit every year.<br/>
As the number of bicycles in operation increases, as well as the cost of maintaining and managing previously purchased bicycles and rental stations, Seoul public bicycle is running into a deficit.<br/>
